# Getting started (own computer)
Follow these step if you want to train DeepStruc and predict with DeepStruc locally on your own computer.

## Install requirements
See the [install](/install) folder. 

## Simulate data
See the [makeData](/data/makeData) folder. 

## Train model
To train your own DeepStruc model simply run:
```
python train.py
```

## Predict
To predict a MMNP using CVAE or your own model on a PDF:
```
python predict.py
```
